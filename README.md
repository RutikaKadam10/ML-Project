### Student Performance Predictor<br>

- Project Overview:<br>
The Student Performance Predictor is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict students' math scores based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course. The project follows a modular approach, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.<br>

- Key Features:<br>
  - Data Processing Pipeline: Automates data ingestion, transformation, and model training.<br>
  - Multiple Regression Models: Trains models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and Linear Regression.<br>
  - Best Model Selection: Uses RÂ² score to choose the most accurate model.<br>
  - Custom Exception Handling: Implements structured error handling for debugging.<br>
  - Modular Code Design: Separates components for easy maintenance.<br>
  - Scalable & Reproducible: Easily extendable for new data and model improvements.<br>
